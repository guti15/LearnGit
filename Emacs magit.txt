Diving into emacs magit to see if it really is magic. 


magit-status  appearently is my friend.   
| Docutmentaion | comand                  |
|---------------+-------------------------|
| magit-status  | M-x magit status  C-x-g |
|               |                         |
  


ok learning more about git itself learned term stage: simlar to add 

magit you stage the file (git add) 
then you commit using -c  (git commit) 
lastly  push 	by using P (git push) 

oh I should not forget pull -F (git pull) 
to delete it is -K  



I will attempt to brush up this notes, but currently opening magit-status 
to open lower windown and just single pressign those keys  c,F,K,P


magit is looking magical
